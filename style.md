# Style

There are many aspects to programming style, from the mundane questions of where to place braces and new lines through to the more interesting questions of how you design and structure your code.

The mundane details of style can often be automaticated by either alterering code to match a particular style or alterting the programmer when code does not match.

This section doesn't deal with the mundane details, instead it looks at the higher level aspects of design and style that cannot easily be automated and require a skilled human to make decisions and weigh up  different tradeoffs.
